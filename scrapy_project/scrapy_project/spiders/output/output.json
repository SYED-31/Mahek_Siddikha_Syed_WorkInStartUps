    "job_description": "We’re an award-winning enterprise software scale-up with high ambitions for growth. We recently won the ScotlandIS Digital Tech Enterprise Business of the Year award and have previously been recognised as Scotland’s fastest-growing tech company in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 for three consecutive years.       Dayshape is an advanced resource management solution, incorporating AI and intelligent automation to help professional services firms optimise their workforce like never before.  It’s built to handle large, complex, and ever-changing requirements with ease.      Our customers include accountancy firms from the Big Four and global top 10, and Dayshape is used in more than 50 countries across five continents. Our target customers are global firms, international networks, and large nationwide or regional organisations, if they’re big enough to have the challenges that Dayshape can solve.     As a company, we live our values every day and we're committed to making sure our friendly and inclusive environment grows with us.    We've come a long way in a short time, but there's still so much more we can do. We have grand ambitions to make Dayshape the most scalable, flexible and rapid to deploy solution on the market, and we’re not there yet. That’s where you come in.  As part of our Engineering team, your key areas of focus will be enhancing product scalability and usability, helping consistently deliver features that support our customers' success. As a senior engineer, you will work collaboratively with the rest of our cross-functional team to plan and deliver new features and enhancements. You will take ownership of features and technical initiatives and make sure they are successful, while keeping an eye on UX, accessibility and aesthetics. This is a full-time role (37.5 hours per week). We typically work from 09:00 - 17:30 from Monday to Friday, though we can be flexible around this, just let us know.  We’re ideally looking for someone in/around Edinburgh, though we’re open to the possibility of this being a remote role (as long as you're in the UK). We're making the most of hybrid working, so you won't need to come into the office everyday (unless you want to!).  We don't mandate required office time, but we find that most of the team enjoy working from home 3-4 days a week, and come into our office to connect with each other, make use of space, and for meetings.  Equality of opportunity is more than just a responsibility: we believe it’s a huge advantage to welcome a variety of experiences and perspectives into the team. Diversity is a great asset and, as such, we strongly encourage applications from any background.  This is your opportunity to really influence how we get things done, and how our product develops to meet our customers’ needs. We're doing well, but there's lots more to do in order to maintain the high bar and pace that we've set.  If your experience isn't an exact match for this job description, but you have transferrable skills/experience that you think would be a great fit, please outline this in a cover letter. Everyone here is growing personally as the company grows, so if that sounds like something you’d like to be part of, we’d love to see your application. We are also currently hiring across the Engineering department, with roles at different levels - all open opportunities can be found on our careers page: https://dayshape.com/careers/",

With 13 million drivers and more than 250,000 spaces, we’re proud to work with some of the UK’s biggest Local Authorities, hotel chains and car park operators. JustPark markets and monetises both unused residential driveways and under-utilised car park capacity, benefitting drivers and creating revenue for space owners. Uniquely in the industry, we focus on both the driver and the operator experience to make parking better for all stakeholders. In addition to working with traditional parking real-estate, we also work with 10,000s of independent landlords and small businesses. We pride ourselves in our ability to provide exceptional service, a smooth onboarding process and being on the cutting edge of innovation. Founded in 2010, ParkHub is the US’s leading event parking technology provider powering the largest venues and stadiums. This includes over 70% of pro-sports teams and managing over $3bn in revenue on their platform. ParkHub is optimising the world’s journeys by providing cutting-edge enterprise technology to support the global parking industry. The company’s products offer contactless payment options, real-time operational data, robust performance analytics, and leading integrations with ticketing and parking reservation providers. Following the merger in April 2024, JustPark and ParkHub now form one of the largest parking organisations globally, serving over 20 million drivers and more than 500 B2B customers, with a combined booking volume exceeding $1 billion. Whereas before, JustPark was purely an expert in consumer parking reservations and on-demand payments, as a combined business we are now also market leaders in providing best-in-class venue and event parking management services and business intelligence. This makes 2024 a hugely exciting time to join our business and we are looking for new team members that will help us execute on the opportunity now in front of us. The Director of Client Success – Reservations is a strategic leader responsible for driving client satisfaction, operational success, and adoption of Reservations and On-Demand product solutions. This senior role oversees the Reservations and On-Demand Client Success function, ensuring that processes, strategies, and team efforts align with the company’s growth objectives. With a focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and long-term client relationships, the Director ensures JustPark remains a leader in delivering value-driven solutions. This role involves overseeing a team of Client Success Managers, providing high-level guidance, and acting as the executive escalation point for complex challenges. It also requires collaborating with senior leadership to align client success strategies with broader organizational goals. We trust you to know what’s needed to get the job done. That's why we work on a hybrid basis (with 1/2 days in the office and Tuesdays & Thursdays being our 'anchor days'), and we’ll work with you to make sure you have the right kit and the right environment for you to succeed. Plus we know it's not all about work! Check out some of the great benefits to joining the JustPark team below:",

The Hub supports innovation in sustainable plastics and multi-materials, with a particular emphasis on tackling industrially relevant research questions. The team is necessarily interdisciplinary, with polymer scientists working with economists, social scientists and life-cycle experts to co-create robust solutions to managing plastic from creation to end-of-life. We are recruiting an enthusiastic and collaborative post-doctoral research associate to join our team to work on a disruptive new project developing thermos-mechanically responsive polymer additives for mechanical recycling. Although it is one of the most sustainable solutions for end-of-life processing of plastics, mechanical recycling can suffer the drawback of producing recyclate with inferior mechanical, optical and thermal properties when compared to virgin plastic. This role will involve developing novel synthetic routes to embed thermally sensitive mechanophores into commodity polymers to investigate and improve the degradation induced during mechanical recycling. Understanding and controlling such degradation processes will be key to improving the quality of mechanically recycled products. You should have, or be working towards, a PhD or equivalent in either polymer chemistry, engineering, processing, or a closely related field. Understanding, either academic or experiential, in polymer chemistry is essential, ideally in one or more of synthesis, processing (extrusion) or sustainability. You should be capable of working under your own initiative, collaborating with others, and possess excellent communication and organisational skills. Our School and our Hub are committed to Athena SWAN principles to promote women in science and to broader equality, diversity and inclusion efforts. The University of Manchester values a diverse workforce and welcomes applications from all sections of the community. The project is a new collaboration between Dr Niamh Fox and Prof. Mike Shaver, with this role complementing an incoming PhD student to further strengthen the project. Mike is Director of both the Sustainable Materials Innovation Hub and the Sustainable Futures research platform while Niamh leads research focused on the scalability of polymer mechanochemistry into real-world processes. Our space supports diverse research impact in polymer synthesis, functional materials, degradable multi-materials, chemical and mechanical recycling and waste management to deliver holistic solutions to retain plastics in their highest value condition and realise social, economic and environmental sustainability.

How do species respond to stress? What are the patterns of extinction in species, and, and at a larger scale, during mass extinctions? How do ecosystems recover from mass extinctions? These processes play out across a wide range of space and time. We can investigate them experimentally using computer models and use empirical datasets to validate results. This project will use the spatially explicit eco-evolutionary simulation software REvoSim to investigate how species ranges, populations, and interactions respond to environmental stressors, and how this changes as species go extinct. We will use the same platform to simulate extinction events on larger temporal and spatial scales, as well as subsequent recoveries. We will compare results from our simulations to - on smaller scales, ecological data, and on larger scales, to large datasets compiled from fossil occurrence data. The final element of the project will combine these data partitions, and assess the potential of different machine learning approaches in identifying species threats when informed by these disparate sources of data; we will compare these outcomes to the wealth of alternative AI approaches developed using complementary data sources.

From van drivers and gig workers to everyday car drivers, our customers are our driving force — they’re at the heart of everything we do.

With 13 million drivers and more than 250,000 spaces, we’re proud to work with some of the UK’s biggest Local Authorities, hotel chains and car park operators. JustPark markets and monetises both unused residential driveways and under-utilised car park capacity, benefitting drivers and creating revenue for space owners. Uniquely in the industry, we focus on both the driver and the operator experience to make parking better for all stakeholders. In addition to working with traditional parking real-estate, we also work with 10,000s of independent landlords and small businesses. We pride ourselves in our ability to provide exceptional service, a smooth onboarding process and being on the cutting edge of innovation. Founded in 2010, ParkHub is the US’s leading event parking technology provider powering the largest venues and stadiums.

The company’s products offer contactless payment options, real-time operational data, robust performance analytics, and leading integrations with ticketing and parking reservation providers. Following the merger in April 2024, JustPark and ParkHub now form one of the largest parking organisations globally, serving over 20 million drivers and more than 500 B2B customers, with a combined booking volume exceeding $1 billion. Whereas before, JustPark was purely an expert in consumer parking reservations and on-demand payments, as a combined business we are now also market leaders in providing best-in-class venue and event parking management services and business intelligence.

    "location": "Manchester",

    "job_description": "Offshore geotechnics  1  uom.link/pgr-apply-2425 [uom.link] This 3.5 year PhD is funded by The University of Manchester and The University of Melbourne. Tuition fees will be paid and the successful candidate will receive a tax free stipend set at the UKRI rate (£19,237 for 2024/25) plus health insurance, and relocation support. Offshore wind energy plays a pivotal role in the global transition to sustainable energy. To decarbonize its energy supply and meet Net Zero targets, the UK is aiming for a rapid expansion of offshore renewable energy, with plans to deploy 50GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, including 5GW from floating wind farms. However, efficiently delivering, transporting, and storing this green energy presents significant challenges. Artificial energy islands offer an innovative solution by streamlining the integration of offshore wind farms and minimizing the need for multiple onshore landing points. These islands will facilitate the conversion of green energy into sustainable fuels for aviation and maritime transport. Additionally, they are being proposed as sites for green hydrogen production and battery storage, driving a substantial shift in the green energy landscape. A notable example is the North Sea Energy Island, part of the North Sea Wind Power Hub project. This expansive initiative covers 2.5 square miles and features an airport, harbour and converters that transform wind-generated electricity from AC to DC, allowing for transmission to five neighbouring countries. In light of the escalating risks associated with climate change, it is essential that these critical offshore infrastructures are designed for safe operation and resilience against rising sea levels and extreme marine conditions.     To achieve the ambitious goals for offshore wind energy, it is essential to address the geotechnical challenges associated with building foundations in the unique marine environment of calcareous sand. One key challenge is understanding how moisture distribution within these sandy foundations affects their stability and performance over time. Fluctuations in moisture content, caused by tidal movements and changes in groundwater levels, can lead to uneven settlement, which poses risks to the integrity of offshore structures. Therefore, this project aims to investigate the settlement mechanisms of calcareous sand foundations, focusing on how moisture mitigation strategies can improve their long-term performance.     The project will employ advanced sensing technologies and a digital twin approach to monitor moisture dynamics and foundation behaviour in real-time. By integrating these innovative methods, we will enhance our understanding of the complex interactions within the foundation system.   The project is part of a joint PhD program between The University of Melbourne and The University of Manchester. The student will spend one year at The University of Melbourne, working with world-class experts in offshore engineering, and the remaining time at The University of Manchester. This collaboration will allow the student to gain a global perspective on the challenges of offshore energy development and access to specialized resources at both institutions. Applicants should have, or expect to achieve, at least a 2.1 honours degree or a master’s (or international equivalent) in a relevant science or engineering related discipline. To apply, please contact Dr Xiaomin Xu - xiaomin.xu@manchester.ac.uk. Please include details of your current level of study, academic background and any relevant experience and include a paragraph about your motivation to study this PhD project. £19,237 - please see advert",

    "job_description": "One This 3.5 year PhD project is funded by The University of Manchester. The successful applicants will receive an annual tax free stipend, set at the UKRI rate (£19,237 foor 2024/250 and tuition fees will be paid. This project is for UK students. Burning fossil fuels for energy over the past several centuries has led to today's environmental crisis, making the transition to green energy technologies a global priority. Renewable energy sources offer a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels due to their potential for scalable energy production and minimal carbon emissions. Among the various technologies, photovoltaics (PVs) are attractive, with applications spanning many sectors of our economies. Third-generation photovoltaics are a subcategory of the large PV family and combine features not accessible through commercial PV technologies, including scalable and sustainable manufacturing and eco-friendly materials. Printable organic and metal halide perovskite-based PVs are among the most efficient technologies in this subcategory, achieving over 20% and 26% power conversion efficiencies, respectively. Despite the tremendous recent advances, however, both families face numerous technical challenges that limit their widespread deployment in commercial applications. For example, organic PVs exhibit limited stability, while the most efficient perovskite PVs rely on environmentally harmful compounds. Developing stable and eco-friendly materials and devices could lead to significant breakthroughs for the future photovoltaics industry. Applicants should have, or expect to achieve, at least a 2.1 honours degree or a master’s (or international equivalent) in a relevant science or engineering related discipline.

    "job_description": "Nested is redefining estate agency in the UK. Traditional agency is a solid platform to learn your trade, but it limits agents’ earning potential — and their ability to innovate. Great agents are stifled, and the customer experience has barely changed in decades. We've introduced the Nested Partnership: Bringing onboard best-in-class, hyper-local agents to effectively run their own businesses under the Nested brand. Agents on the Nested platform get a better work-life balance, more autonomy over how they work, and more control over their take-home. In turn, sellers get a better experience with an agent who’s motivated to get them the best possible outcome. We’re a wildly ambitious team — backed by leading VCs that funded the likes of Spotify and Revolut, and led by experienced, hands-on founders. If redefining the property industry is something that motivates you, and you’re looking to take your career to the next level — then come and join the Nested platform as an Area Partner! As a Nested Area Partner, you’ll be in charge of your local strategy, pitch, marketing tactics, and your hours — and, as a result, your earnings. This is estate agency unlike anything you’ve experienced before; you’ll have the autonomy to grow your own estate agency business in the area you know best — from prospecting and canvassing, to valuing and negotiating. You’ll be supercharged by Nested’s marketing support — whether that’s doorknocking, direct mail, flyering a school fête, or running an advert in the local newspaper. We trust our area partners to run their own local advertising, with our marketing professionals on-hand for support at every step. When it comes to your clients, you’ll manage the relationship from start to finish — acting as their single point of contact throughout their Nested journey. You'll have a smart selling app and in-house support at your disposal. The cherry on top? A commission structure that actually rewards you fairly for your hard work and skill. Starting at 75% of revenue and increasing up to 100%, working with Nested gives you the opportunity to take your earnings to the next level. This is a truly all-encompassing role that lets you do estate agency your way, whilst supported by Nested’s brand, products and services. At Nested we embrace diversity and see it as a benefit to our company. That's why we're committed to working with top talent regardless of race, religion, colour, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or status as an individual with a disability",

What if we could make banking infrastructure faster, safer, more reliable, and easier to access for all? Here is where you can think radically and responsibly to find the best solution.  What happens when you know you’re inherently trusted? Trust creates safety. Safety encourages you to be brave, to challenge, to fail, to try new things and to execute. At ClearBank everything revolves around trust. We’re not expected to earn it, but we are expected not to break it. We’re trusted to own it. To solve issues in the moment. To know a good risk when we see one, and the judgement to know that ‘can’ doesn’t always mean you ‘should’.  ClearBank is a place where you can do things differently and challenge the status quo.

    "location": "Bristol",
    "job_type": "N/A",
    "job_description": "Nested is redefining estate agency in the UK. Traditional agency is a solid platform to learn your trade, but it limits agents’ earning potential — and their ability to innovate. Great agents are stifled, and the customer experience has barely changed in decades. We've introduced the Nested Partnership: Bringing onboard best-in-class, hyper-local agents to effectively run their own businesses under the Nested brand. Agents on the Nested platform get a better work-life balance, more autonomy over how they work, and more control over their take-home. In turn, sellers get a better experience with an agent who’s motivated to get them the best possible outcome. We’re a wildly ambitious team — backed by leading VCs that funded the likes of Spotify and Revolut, and led by experienced, hands-on founders. If redefining the property industry is something that motivates you, and you’re looking to take your career to the next level — then come and join the Nested platform as an Area Partner! As a Nested Area Partner, you’ll be in charge of your local strategy, pitch, marketing tactics, and your hours — and, as a result, your earnings. This is estate agency unlike anything you’ve experienced before; you’ll have the autonomy to grow your own estate agency business in the area you know best — from prospecting and canvassing, to valuing and negotiating. You’ll be supercharged by Nested’s marketing support — whether that’s doorknocking, direct mail, flyering a school fête, or running an advert in the local newspaper. We trust our area partners to run their own local advertising, with our marketing professionals on-hand for support at every step. When it comes to your clients, you’ll manage the relationship from start to finish — acting as their single point of contact throughout their Nested journey. You'll have a smart selling app and in-house support at your disposal. The cherry on top? A commission structure that actually rewards you fairly for your hard work and skill. Starting at 75% of revenue and increasing up to 100%, working with Nested gives you the opportunity to take your earnings to the next level. This is a truly all-encompassing role that lets you do estate agency your way, whilst supported by Nested’s brand, products and services. At Nested we embrace diversity and see it as a benefit to our company. That's why we're committed to working with top talent regardless of race, religion, colour, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or status as an individual with a disability",

    "location": "London,London",
    "job_type": "Full time",
    "job_description": "In the future, almost everything we consume will simply materialise on our doorsteps – what we call “e-commerce” today will simply be “commerce” tomorrow. But if we continue on today’s trajectory, the growth of e-commerce risks damaging the environment, alienating our communities, and straining the bottom-line for small businesses. Relay is an e-commerce-native logistics network. We are built from the ground up for environmental, social, and economic sustainability. By building from the ground up we are able to entirely rethink both the middle and last mile enabling us to reduce the number of miles driven to deliver each parcel, lower carbon emissions, and lower costs, all while channelling funds to community members. At the same time, we’re fixing the last broken aspect of e-commerce for consumers: delivery. As shoppers, we should have complete control over when and how we receive our purchases, and we should be able to return unwanted items as easily as we ordered them. That’s why whenever you buy from a merchant powered by Relay, you’ll be able to reschedule your delivery at any time. And if you don’t like what you ordered, at the tap of a button we’ll send someone to pick it up. To orchestrate this complex ballet, Relay relies on a wide range of technologies, from advanced routing and planning to sophisticated user experiences that guide our team members on the ground. We are looking for a talented Senior Business Analyst to join our Operations team. In this role, you will have the opportunity to help us pioneer, codify and scale our most important strategic and operational processes within the First Mile, Middle Mile and Pitstop operations. The First Mile collects the parcel from our clients and brings it to our Sort Centres, where the parcels are sorted into different delivery zones. After sortation, the Middle Mile team takes over and delivers these parcels in bags to our Pitstop network. A parcel then may be collected from the Pitstop directly by the customer, or a Last Mile courier could home deliver it to the recipient, depending on preference.  As a Senior Business Analyst you will be at the forefront of data-driven decision-making. You will use your analytical skills to solve complex problems and provide valuable insights that directly influence our business and operations strategies. You will be using SQL and Tableau. Work closely with the First Mile, Middle Mile, and Pitstop teams to understand their needs and deliver impactful solutions Own the design, development, and maintenance of ongoing metrics, reports, analyses, dashboards, etc. to drive weekly meetings and reporting Perform ad-hoc analyses to deliver insights and help ops leaders make fast, data-driven decisions (e.g. why was First Mile late yesterday?) Discover, analyse and interpret trends or patterns in complex data sets (e.g. identify poor pitstop behaviour resulting in higher network costs) Analyse policy changes (e.g. updating driver pay structures) and make recommendations to our ops leadership team Simulate operational outcomes based on different strategic decisions (e.g. impact of adding pitstop locations on Middle Mile cost per parcel) Spend time in the field to design, implement, and continuously refine processes to enhance the operational efficiency and reliability of our delivery network You want to play an active part in reducing the environmental impact of a massive industry while giving   people access to the benefits of e-commerce You are excited to take on a wide range of challenges, learn new skills, and master new domains in business and technology You are equally at home sweating the details of an operational process or data analysis as you are presenting your conclusions to executives You’re a problem solver and thrive when given a complex challenge You are not afraid to get your hands dirty and feel comfortable working in a fast paced environment Minimum of 3+ years of experience as business analyst/ data analyst or related field Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with the ability to interpret complex data and identify actionable insights Experience with SQL, data visualization using Tableau, or similar tools Excellent communication (both written and verbal) and presentation skills to senior stakeholders Quick learner, proactive, and resilient, with the ability to cope well under pressure in a fast paced environment Highly motivated and willing to take on multiple responsibilities at once Have a degree or equivalent experience in a quantitative or applied discipline 25 days annual leave per year (plus bank holidays).
